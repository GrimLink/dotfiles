# Atom

I personally moved to [VSCode](../vscode/README.md) for most my needs.

This is just an archive of my old preferences.

## Install

If you want try these preferrences's.
First install [Atom](https://atom.io/).

First boot and run from Atom the apm install cli command.

Then run from the dotfiles.
The atom/setup.sh script.

And you're done.

## What's in the ðŸ“¦

The setup will install;
* via `apm` my preferred extensions.
* rsync the;
  * config
  * keymap
  * snippets
  (most of my snippets are in the extension [WS-Concepts/Atom-Snippets](https://github.com/WS-Concepts/Atom-Snippets))
  * styles
  (Some small edits for the material theme)
