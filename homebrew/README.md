# Homebrew

## Main

The main file will install brew (if not yet installed).
And then install some main things I use, e.g. node, php, composer.

Some other things are also installed via brew but are more part of the ValetPlus setup.

## Cask

The cask task will install almost all applications via brew.

**This includes;**

* firefox-developer-edition
* hyper
* sequel-pro
* tower
* transmit
* vlc
* dropbox
* boostnote
* **Editors**
  * visual-studio-code
  * atom
  * graphiql
  * postman
* **Communication**
  * slack
  * skype
* **Utils**
  * google-backup-and-sync
  * imageoptim
  * appcleaner
  * keka
  * keepingyouawake

_Chrome is not include._
_Since the normal version is only part of the brew cask, I use the Beta version_
