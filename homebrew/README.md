# Homebrew

## Main

The main file will install brew (if not yet installed).
And then install some main things I use, e.g. node, php, composer.

Some other things are also installed via brew but are more part of the ValetPlus setup.

## Cask

The cask task will install almost all applications via brew, that I use.
