# Bash

This contains all the config I have used for my bash setup.

I have switched to zsh.
Since the upcoming macOS version Catalina will ship with it by default.

Also zsh has some nice features, like autocomplete.
So that is also a good reason.

That said.
This is still a really nice setup.
If you don't want to use something other than bash.

## Prompt

This prompt look like the [pure prompt from sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure).

Also has a git checker build in.

## Shell

The shell options,
like aliases are are found under [the shell folder](../README,md).

These options are not bound to which shell you are using.
