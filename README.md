# Dotfiles

My DEV setup.
Containing things like the Shell, MacOS config, Valet Plus and more..

> :warning: These are my personal settings.
> Don't run the scripts without understanding what the code does.

## Setup

You can download or clone the repository wherever you want.

_I like to keep it in `~/dotfiles`._

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -LsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GrimLink/dotfiles/master/get.sh)"
```

## Install

If it is your first install.
Run the `install.sh` script.

```bash
./dotfiles/install.sh
```

Follow the steps for each script, that is called via the install script.

_Use the flag `--force` or `-f` to skip the questions for each config_

## Sync

`sync.sh` updates the dotfiles and resync the config files.

The sync will not re-download apps 

```bash
./dotfiles/sync.sh
```

_Use the flag `--force` or `-f` to skip the questions for each config_

## Whats in the box

Each folder contains a readme with details on each config
