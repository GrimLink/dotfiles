> :warning: These are my personal settings.
> Don't run the scripts without understanding what the code does.

## Setup

You can clone the repository wherever you want.
I like to keep it in `~/projects/dotfiles`.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:GrimLink/dotfiles.git
```

## Install

If it is your first install.
Run the `install.sh` script.
You can simply `source` it or make it executable.

```bash
source ~/projects/dotfiles/install.sh
```

Follow the steps for each script, that is called via the install script.
