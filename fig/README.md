# Fig CLI

Site: https://fig.io/

Traditionally, I manage my Zsh plugins in the .zshrc file.

However, I can now use Fig to handle all of this,
and it even syncs my plugins across devices, just like VSCode.

## Install

```sh
brew install --cask fig
```

## Open

```sh
fig
```

## Plugins

### Install

```sh
fig plugins add zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

Other cool options I use are;

- zsh-nvm
- pure

### Configure

```sh
fig plugins configure zsh-syntax-highlighting
```
