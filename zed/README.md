# Zed

This contains all my personal Zed settings.

## Install

```sh
brew install --cask zed
```

## CLI Options

For all options see: https://zed.dev/docs/reference/cli

## Prompts

The commit message is saved in a db file so this needs to be added manually.

Go to **Assistant Panel → Prompt Library → Commit Message**.

Replace this prompt with the one in `./prompt/commit-message.md`
