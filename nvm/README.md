# NVM

This only runs a few setup steps for NVM

Make sure to isntall, using one of the options found at:

- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- [NVM ZSH](https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm#install)
- [FIG](https://app.fig.io/plugins/zsh-nvm) (My preferd setup option)

> If your using [FIG] this script will make sure it has installed all plugins
