# Homebrew

Homebrew is my go-to package manager. If I can install something with Homebrew, I will.

Most tools and apps I use, can be found in this folder, and they are installed using the shell scripts.

I find Homebrew to be a very easy-to-use and reliable package manager. It has a wide range of packages available, and it is constantly being updated with new packages.

I highly recommend Homebrew to anyone who is looking for a way to manage their software on macOS.
