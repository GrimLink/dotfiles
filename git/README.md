# Git

## Config

All none personal config setting I like.

The `setup.sh` (inside this folder) will ask for some personal config.
That it will add to the config.

## Ignore (Global)

Contains all ignore rules for global use cases.

For more infomation about this approach see the [git doc](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/#create-a-global-gitignore)
