# Git

## Config

All none personal config setting I like for git.

The `setup.sh` (inside this folder) will ask for some personal settings;
* Git Username
* Git Email

## Ignore (Global)

Contains all gitignore rules for global use cases.

e.g. system files like `.DS_Store`

For more infomation about this approach see the [git doc](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/#create-a-global-gitignore)

## SSH

The ssh script will setup a new ssh key.

_If you already have one._
_Don't run this script as it will overide it._
