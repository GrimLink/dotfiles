# ZSH

This contains all the config I have used for my zsh setup.

## Keybindings

By default on macOS the terminal allows you to use `⌘ + →` to go to the end.
And `⌘ + ←` to go to the start.

This feature in not by default in zsh setup so I have added these keybindings.

## Shell

The shell options,
like aliases are are found under [the shell folder](../README,md).

These options are not bound to which shell you are using.
