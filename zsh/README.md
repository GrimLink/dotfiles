# ZSH

This contains all the config I have used for my zsh setup.

## Prompt

This uses the [pure prompt from sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure).

## Syntax highlighting

I am using the zsh-syntax-highlighting.
Which looks nice but also really helps me type my command correct.

## Keybindings

By default on macOS the terminal allows you to use `⌘ + →` to go to the end.
And `⌘ + ←` to go to the start.

This feature in not by default in zsh setup so I have added these keybindings.

## Shell

The shell options,
like aliases are are found under [the shell folder](../README,md).

These options are not bound to which shell you are using.
