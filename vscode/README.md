# VSCode

My VSCode settings are synced to the cloud, so I don't keep a local copy.

I change my settings too often to keep a reliable backup.

However, I do have a nice backup of all my snippets and keybindings.

## CLI Options

For all options see: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line

### Install Shell CMD (MacOS)

```sh
# Add Visual Studio Code (shell), manually
export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"
```
