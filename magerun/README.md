# Magerun

While ValetPlus also installs magerun.

I like to have the latest version installed instead.

## Commands

With the install. Magerun is renamed from `n98-magerun.phar` to just `magerun`.
So for magento 2 this is `magerun2`.

In the [shell/applications](../shell/applications) there are also 2 aliases for both.

m1 = magerun

m2 = magerun2
